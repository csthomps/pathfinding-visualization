Pathfinding Visualization

To use:
First left click will place start tile (orange)
Second left click will place end tile (blue)

Right click on start or end tile to remove it, then left click again to replace it

All other right clicks will place walls, left click on wall tile to remove it

Rectangles on right side are options to choose:
- Which pathfinding algorithm to run
- Whether to show algorithms step by step (including maze algorithm)
- Button to run the algorithm
- Button to generate a maze
- Button to clear back a step (clear pathfinding results first, then all wall/start/end tiles)
